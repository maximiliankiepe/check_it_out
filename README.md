# db setup
1) install rethink db on your machine: https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/

2) cd into project directory and run: `$ rethinkdb`. This will create a `rethinkdb_data` folder in your project dir and start the rethinkdb server.
Go to `http://localhost:8080/#tables` to see the admin interface (looks cool).

3) Run server.js in the terminal and go to localhost://3000, then check it out!
